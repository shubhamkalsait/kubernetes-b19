## Architecture of Kubernetes
-   **Kubernetes Cluster mainly consists of a Control Plane and Worker Machines called Nodes**
-   **It is also called as Master-Slave system**
-   **We can create single or multiple master nodes for high availability and scalability.**
-   **We also can create multiple slave nodes to handle worl load**
-   **key components and architecture of Kubernetes:**

     <ins>**API Server:**</ins>
     -   The API Server acts as the central management entity and the frontend interface for the Kubernetes control plane.
     -   It processes RESTful requests to manage cluster resources and updates the corresponding objects in etcd.
     -   It serves as the communication hub for other control plane components to interact and manage the cluster.
               
     <ins>**ETCD:**</ins>
     -   etcd is a lightweight, distributed key-value store that securely and consistently stores the critical data of the Kubernetes cluster.
     -   It holds the cluster's configuration and state, including information about nodes, pods, configurations, secrets, and the state of workloads.
       
     <ins>**Scheduler:**</ins>
     -   The Scheduler is responsible for assigning workloads, specifically pods, to appropriate nodes.
     -   It selects nodes for new pods based on resource requirements, quality of service requirements, affinity specifications, and other criteria.
       
     <ins>**Controller Manager:**</ins>
     -   This component runs various controller processes in the background to regulate the state of the cluster and handle routine tasks.
     -   It helps in maintaining the desired state of the cluster.
       
     <ins>**kublet**:</ins>
     -   The kubelet is responsible for executing commands that come from the Kubernetes control plane, including instructions from the scheduler.
     -   It communicates with the control plane and ensures that containers within pods are running as expected.
       
     <ins>**Kube-proxy:**</ins>
     -   Kube-proxy maintains network rules on nodes, allowing communication between Pods.
     -   It handles network forwarding, load balancing, and service-related network tasks.
       
     <ins>**Container Engine:**</ins>
     -   The container engine on a worker node is responsible for executing and managing containers.
     -   It provides the runtime environment for running containerized applications within the Kubernetes cluster, handling tasks such as container creation, start-up, and resource isolation.
       
     <ins>**POD:**</ins>
     -   A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.
     -   It's like wrapper around container.
     -   The worker node executes and hosts these Pods, running the specified containers within them.

## Lifecycle of kubernetes
-   A user or application initiates a request to create a new pod.
-   The API server, the central control point, communicates with ETCD, a persistent data store, to gather information about available nodes.
-   The scheduler, responsible for pod placement, analyzes resource availability and constraints to choose the best node for the pod.
-   The API server informs the kubelet, the agent running on the selected node, about the pod scheduling decision.
-   The kubelet creates the pod's containers and manages its lifecycle on that node.
-   The kubelet sends status updates back to the API server about the pod's progress.
-   The API server stores the updated cluster state information in ETCD, ensuring a consistent view for all components.
